To-do's 
--------

- [ ] 1. Test function with pixel variance to see if variance can be discarded; 
- [ ] 2. Improve code execution time;
- [ ] 3. Save the final images results in a folder;
- [ ] 4. If there are black pixels in Luffy's clothes because of the cumulated error increase - test "broadcasting" the error derivative;
- [ ] 5. Test stochastic method with 1, 2 and 3 neighbouring points using variance instead of mean.
